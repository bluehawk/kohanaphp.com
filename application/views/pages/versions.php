	<h1>Which version of Kohana should I use?</h1>
	
	<p>First a brief history lesson: Several developers who used the <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> Framework made a fork called <a href="http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/53347/">BlueFlame</a>, which had some various changes that they felt should be in CodeIgniter.  Eventually the project split ways from CodeIgnitor and was renamed to Kohana.  Kohana continued to develop, remaining fairly similar to CodeIgniter.  You can upgrade from CodeIgnitor to Kohana 2.3.4 <a href="">fairly easily</a>.  A second branch of Kohana was created, the 3.x branch.  It is essentially a rewrite of the framework.  It still shares alot of the same principals, ideas, and design goals, but there are some major differences:</p>
